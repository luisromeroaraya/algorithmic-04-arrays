# Arrays
* Type of challenge: **learning**
* Duration: **60 min**
* Team challenge: **solo**

## Learning objectives
At the end of this challenge you should:
* understand the concept of arrays
* be able to declare arrays
* be able to assign values to an array
* be able to select a value in an array

## The mission
This challenge will have you play around with the concept of [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type), complete the exercises down below after you’ve read the explanations.

Arrays are variables of sort, but their specificity is that they can hold multiple values at the same time. If a variables is a box holding a value, then an array is a table containing multiple box.

In computer science an array **begins at 0**, meaning that the first element is on the index 0. They have specific sub functions to ```add array.add_value``` and remove ```array.remove_value``` data.

Example
```
// This algorithm will output "Arsène Adalric Aelis".
array names = ["Arsène","Adalric","John"]

remove_value(names[2])
add_value("Aelis",$names)

output($names[0] + " " + $names[1] + " " + $names[2])
```

## Exercises

Instructions
* write your algorithm on paper
* detail each and every step
* indicates the types of used variables

I - print an array
- [ ] Write an algorithm which prints everything in an array.

II - maximum
- [ ] Write an algorithm which receives an array of integers and prints its **maximum**.

III - minimum
- [ ] Write an algorithm which receives an array of integers and prints its **minimum**.

IV - minimum position
- [ ] Write an algorithm which receives an array of integers and prints the position of its **minimum**.

V - ordered array
- [ ] Write a algorithm which receives an array of integers and check if its ordered ascendantly. Print *true* if the array is ordered, *false* if it’s not.
